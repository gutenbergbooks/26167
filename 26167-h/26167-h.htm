<h2>Preface to Second Edition</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE success which has attended this little
work from its first appearance, and the
approval with which it has been received
prompts me to issue a second and revised
edition.</div>

<p>Regret has been expressed by some, that I
omitted to give a description of all the windows,
and that there were no illustrations in the first
edition. This I have endeavoured to remedy by
giving the subjects of all the windows (with here
and there a special note) and inserting some
pictures of the Chapel both inside and out, also
the arms and supporters (a dragon and greyhound)
of Henry VII, crowned rose and portcullis,
from the walls of the ante-chapel and the
initials H.A. from the screen.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Messrs. Sir Isaac Pitman and
Sons Ltd., 1 Amen Corner, London, for the loan
of the blocks of the former, which appeared in
the late Sir William St. John Hope's book
<i>Heraldry for Craftsmen and Designers</i>. The
latter, together with three photographs of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Chapel, were specially taken for me by Mr.
A. Broom. I wish also to thank the
Provost of Eton, Dr. M. R. James, for permission
to use some part of his description
of the windows. I am also indebted to Mr. J.
Palmer Clark for leave to reproduce the photograph
of the ship in the window on the south
side. I am also grateful to Mr. Benham and
Dr. Mann for their assistance in compiling
the lists of Provosts and Organists. I
have again to thank Sir G. W. Prothero,
Honorary Fellow of the College, for reading
through the manuscript and proofs of both
editions and for his valuable suggestions. In
conclusion, I would ask for the kind indulgence
of my readers for any errors that may be discovered
in this little book, and shall be glad to
have them pointed out to me.</p>

<h2>The Foundation</h2>


<div class='cap'>IN the year 1441 Henry VI<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> founded King's
College for a Rector and twelve scholars.
He remodelled his plan in 1443, and styled his
foundation the College of St. Mary and St.
Nicholas.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was to consist of a Provost,
seventy Fellows, or Scholars, together with
Chaplains, Lay Clerks, and Choristers. The court
was originally on the north side of the present
chapel opposite Clare College, and was the home
of many generations of Kingsmen until about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
1825. In 1829 this court was sold to the University,
and the buildings thereon were demolished
to make way for an extension of the
University Library; but the old entrance gateway
was happily spared and incorporated with
the new Library building, and stands there, as a
"venerable and beautiful specimen of architecture,"
at the present day.</div>

<p>On St. James' Day, July 25th, 1446, the King
laid the foundation stone of the chapel, and so
began a building which, as a distinguished
member of the college (Lord Orford) said, would
"alone be sufficient to ennoble any age." It
has been classed with the chapel of Henry VII
at Westminster and Saint George's collegiate
church at Windsor, as one of "the three great
royal chapels of the Tudor age"; but there is no
edifice, except Eton College Chapel, which forms
in any way a fair subject of comparison with
that of King's College.</p>

<p>The <i>style</i> is rich perpendicular, marking the
point where the last Gothic meets the early
Renaissance. Nicholas Close has commonly been
considered to be the architect. He was a man of
Flemish family, and for a few years held the cure
of the parish of St. John Zachary, which church
stood on the west side of Milne Street, and
probably so close to it that the high altar of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
church was on ground afterwards enclosed within
the western bays of the Ante-Chapel. Close, in
1450, was appointed to the See of Carlisle, and
in 1452 transferred to Lichfield. He certainly
received from the King the grant of a coat of
arms for his services, but it might fairly be said
that John Langton, Master of Pembroke College,
and Chancellor of the University, who also had
the title of "Surveyor," a term generally admitted
to be synonymous with architect, has an
equally strong claim. But Mr. G. G. Scott, in
his essay on English Church Architecture, says
"the man who really should have had the credit
of conceiving this great work was the master-mason,
Reginald Ely, appointed by a patent of
Henry VI to press masons, carpenters, and other
workers." According to Mr. Scott's view, "Close
and his successors did the work which in modern
days would be done, though less efficiently, by a
building committee. But they were ecclesiastics,
not architects; it is the master-mason,
not the more dignified 'surveyor,' to whom
the honour of planning the building should be
attributed."</p>

<h2>Royal Benefactors</h2>

</a><span class="caption">Looking East from Provost Stall</span>
</div>

<div class='cap'>BESIDES the founder, whose misfortunes
hindered the completion of his work, four
successive kings aided in its erection. When
Henry was taken prisoner at St. Albans in 1455,
the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick promised to
supply funds for the college buildings. For a
time they kept their word, and some part of the
&pound;1,000 a year promised by Henry from the Duchy
of Lancaster continued to be paid; but the
defeat of the King at the battle of Towton in
1461 and the subsequent overthrow of the
Lancaster dynasty checked progress. "After a
long time spent in hiding in secret places, wherein
for safety's sake he was forced to keep close, he
was found and taken, brought as a traitor and
criminal to London, and imprisoned in the Tower,
and eventually suffered a violent death. He was
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bnried'">buried</ins> at Chertsey Abbey, but his body was
afterwards removed to Windsor Castle."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Still,
the idea was there, and it remained for a later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
generation only to imitate and complete. In
1483, just before Edward IV's death, we find
that nearly &pound;1,300 had been spent on the chapel,
about &pound;1,100 given by the King, and &pound;100 by
Thomas Rotherham, Archbishop of York, Lord
Chancellor of England, formerly a Fellow of the
College, but it is not stated how the deficit was
met. Richard III, on his accession, resumed
the work with great vigour. Between May and
December, 1484, about &pound;750 was spent, nearly all
of which was provided by the king.</div>

<p>It is stated that in the year 1506 sufficient
progress had been made in the building to admit
of the performance of divine service, at which
Henry VII and his mother, Margaret Countess
of Richmond, Foundress of St. John's and
Christ's Colleges, who were on a visit to Cambridge,
were present; and it is said that John
Fisher, President of Queens' College, Bishop of
Rochester, took part as chief celebrant. Professor
Willis, in <i>The Architectural History of the
University of Cambridge</i>, takes exception to this
statement. He is of opinion that, as the Screen
and Stall work was not finished until 1536, and
as the old Chapel<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> did not fall down until 1537
(in fact it was used on the eve of the day on which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
it fell), it is unlikely that the new chapel was used
for service until that time. He further quotes
Dr. Caius to strengthen this view.</p>

<p>Henry VII, who has been credited with an
excessive tendency to accumulate treasure, was,
next to the Founder, much the largest contributor.
A short time before his death in 1509<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
moved perhaps to emulate the liberal example
of his pious mother, he gave &pound;5,000 to the college,
with instructions to his executors to finish the
building. May we not also think that Richard
Fox, Founder of Corpus Christi College, Oxford,
Bishop of Winchester from 1500 to 1528, who
was Henry VII's constant adviser, Privy Seal,
and one of his executors, had something to do
with this mark of Henry's generosity and favour?
This sum of &pound;5,000 was probably all spent by
the beginning of 1512, when the King's executors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
made over to the Provost and scholars, in 1511-12,
a second sum of &pound;5,000.</p>

<p>Thus in 1515, in the 7th year of King Henry
VIII's reign, the stonework of the chapel was
completed; it had cost, in the present value of
money, about &pound;160,000. The stone used in the
construction is of different kinds. The white
magnesian limestone from Huddlestone in Yorkshire
is that which was chiefly used in the lifetime
of the Founder. The lower part of the walls
was built of this; the upper part was built with
stone brought from Clipsham in Rutlandshire in
1477. A third kind, from Weldon in Northamptonshire,
was used for the vaulting of the choir
and ante-chapel, executed in 1512 and the
following years. The north and south porches
were vaulted with a magnesian limestone, more
yellow in colour, from the Yorkshire quarry of
Hampole.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 325px;">
<a href="images/i021-big.jpg"><img src="images/i021.jpg" width="325" height="500" alt="The Screen from West End" title="The Screen from West End" />
</a><span class="caption">The Screen from West End</span>
</div>

<p>The outside measurement of the chapel from
turret to turret is 310 feet, the said turrets being
146 feet high. The four westernmost buttresses
on the south and five on the north side are
ornamented with heraldic devices, crowns, roses,
and portcullises, while on the set-offs separating
the stages are dragons, greyhounds, and antelopes
bearing shields.</p>


<p>Inside, the chapel is 289 feet long, 40 feet wide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
from pier to pier, and 80 feet high from the
floor to the central point of the stone vault.
The <i>tracery</i> of the roof is a fine specimen of the
fan-vault which is rarely to be found in Continental
architecture, but is the peculiar glory
of the English style. It can truly be said that
stone seems, by the cunning labour of the
chisel, to have been robbed of its weight and
density and suspended aloft as if by magic,
while the fretted roof is achieved with the
wonderful minuteness and airy security of a
cobweb. Similar roofs appear in Bath Abbey
(the architect of which was Dr. Oliver King, a
member of King's), in St. George's Chapel,
Windsor, in Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster,
in Sherborne Minster, and in the ambulatory of
the choir of Peterborough; but the earliest
example of this kind of vaulting is the cloister
of Gloucester (1381-1412), of which the late Dean
Spence speaks in the following lines:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Old Gloucester's peerless cloister, once the haunt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of mitred Abbot and of monk in cowl.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Above we see the long fan-traceried arch;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Beneath are letter'd stones and human dust."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The same words can be applied to this chapel,
for here we have the long fan-traceried arch, and
beneath are stones and human dust, for many
members of King's and others are buried within
its walls.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<h2>Work of Freemasons</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT may be that some of my readers are members
of the Masonic body. Mr. John Proctor
Carter, sometime Fellow of King's and Eton, in
writing a history of the chapel, published in 1867,
writes thus: "So many learned authors have
been at fault when they have ventured into the
obscurity which envelops the history of the
Freemasons, by a gang of whom this chapel, in
common with, at all events, a large number of
mediaeval buildings were erected, that to say a
word upon the subject may seem presumptuous.
The theory of a traditional science, confined
entirely to the members of a secret society that
had ramified over the whole of civilised Europe,
and to whom developments in architecture were
due, has been pushed to extremity by some
writers. By a natural reaction others have been
led to discredit altogether the existence of such a
society, and to consider the masonic fraternity
merely as one of the various trade corporations
or guilds whose relics have descended to our
own day. But apart from the argument drawn
from universal belief, there is probably sufficient
evidence to show that the Freemasons were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
distinguished to some extent from other guilds,
partly by the possession of peculiar secrets, and
partly by their religious character. They seem
to have been as it were the knight-errants of
architecture, and to have <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ravelled'">travelled</ins> from city
to city and country to country in the exercise
of what they must have deemed a half sacred
profession."</div>

<p>Ample proof has been adduced that Henry VI
was not only a Mason himself (having been
admitted a member of the fraternity in 1450),
but did a good deal for the craft; and Freemasonry
has much to thank him for. In a
history of Westminster Abbey, written by the
late Dean Farrar, is to be found the following:
"Even the geometrical designs which lie at the
base of its ground plan are combinations of the
triangle, the circle, and the oval." Masons'
marks are to be found in various places on the
walls in chapel.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<h2>The Windows</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 226px;">
<a href="images/i026-big.jpg"><img src="images/i026.jpg" width="226" height="500" alt="Ship Window" title="Ship Window" />
</a><span class="caption">Ship Window</span>
</div>

<div class='cap'>AS I have previously mentioned, the building
was begun in 1446, but, owing to the long
Civil Wars, it dragged on until 1515; and it was
in that year that a contract was entered into with
one Barnard Flower, to glaze the windows "with
good, clene, sure, and perfyte glass, according to
the old and new lawe," or, as we should put it,
the Old and New Testament. Barnard Flower
died between July 25, 1517, the date of his will,
and August 14, 1517, the date when the will was
proved, having completed only four windows,
one of which is generally believed to be that
over the north door, while a second faces the
organ on the same side. He describes himself
as "Barnard Floure, the Kinges glasyer of
England, dwelling within the precynt of Saint
Martin hospitale, in the Burgh of Southwark,
in the county of Surrey." In 1526 two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
contracts were entered into with other firms to
complete the rest of the windows, which was done
in 1531. Among the names of those who entered
into the last contract were two Flemings.
Windows of a similar kind, although smaller, are
to be found at Fairford in Gloucestershire; these
date from about 1490.</div>

<p>The windows of the Chapel contain the finest
series in the world of pictures in glass on a large
scale. The tracery is filled with heraldic devices.
At the top of the centre light are the Royal Arms
as borne by Henry VII, and the rest of the
badges are Roses, Crowns, Portcullises, Hawthorn
bushes and Fleur-de-lys, being all appropriate
to Henry VII. There are also the initials
H. E. (Henry VII and Elizabeth of York) and
H. K. for Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon
as Prince and Princess of Wales. These badges
run all round the side windows. In each side
window there are four subjects, two side lights
above and two below the transom or crossbar,
while in the centre light are four figures, men
and angels alternately, "Messengers," as they
are called, because they hold scrolls or tablets
(in Latin) descriptive of the pictures at the
sides. All the side windows, except the easternmost
window on the south side, are carried
out in a similar manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>In most cases the two lower pictures illustrate
two scenes in the New Testament, and the two
upper ones give types of these scenes drawn
from the Old Testament or elsewhere. There
are exceptions to this arrangement, as, for
instance, the first two windows on the north
side and in those illustrating the Acts of the
Apostles.</p>

<p>The main <i>subjects of the windows</i> are the life
of the Virgin Mary and the life of Christ. The
scenes begin with the Birth of the Virgin, in the
westernmost window on the north side, and
proceed through the principal events of our
Lord's life to the Crucifixion in the east window.
This is followed on the south side by the following
events as recorded in the Gospels, of which
the last depicted is the Ascension in the one
opposite the organ. Next comes the history
of the Apostles as recorded in the Acts, while
the legendary history of the Virgin occupies
the last two windows.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>The following diagram may be of use in helping
my readers to decipher the windows on the north

<h3><span class="smcap">Window XIII.</span></h3>

<p>The <i>East Window</i> is quite different. For one thing it
is much larger, and has nine vertical divisions instead of
five. Here, in the tracery, in addition to other heraldic
badges, is the "Dragon of the great Pendragonship,"
holding a banner with the arms of Henry VII. Also
there is seen the ostrich feather of the Prince of Wales
with the motto "Ich Dien."<a name="FNanchor_7_19" id="FNanchor_7_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_19" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In this window there are no Messengers with inscriptions;
only six scenes from the Passion beginning at the
bottom left hand corner, and each occupying three lights
instead of two. In the first three lights below the
transom is the Ecce Homo; in the centre three, Pilate
washing his hands, the final moment in the trial. Our
Lord is represented in the centre light with his back to
the spectator. In the three on the right is Christ bearing
the Cross. Here is shown Saint Veronica kneeling and
offering to our Lord a handkerchief to wipe his face. The
legend goes on to say that, when he returned it to her,
his face was impressed upon it; and it is now one of the
four great relics preserved in the piers of the dome of
St. Peter's at Rome.</p>

<p>Above the transom, the left three lights contain the
Nailing to the Cross. In the centre three is Christ
crucified between the thieves. At the base of the Cross
may be seen our Lord's robe on the ground, and two
figures kneeling upon it and pointing down to pieces of
paper or dice, a scene depicting the fulfilment of the
prophecy: "They parted my garments among them and
upon my vesture they did cast lots." In the right three
lights the body of Christ is taken down from the Cross.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Window</span> XXVI.</h3>

<p>The <i>West Window</i> was filled with stained glass depicting
the Last Judgment, by Messrs. Clayton and Bell, of
London, in 1879. There is no doubt that in the original
scheme of the windows this was intended to be the subject
of the west window.<a name="FNanchor_8_32" id="FNanchor_8_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_32" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Like the east window, it
consists of nine lights, divided by a transom into two
tiers. The general idea is to set forth the scene of the
Judgment as within a vast hall of semi-circular plan. In
the central light of the upper tier is seated the figure of
our Lord on the throne of judgment. On each side of
the principal figure are groups of angels jubilant with
trumpets and bearing emblems of the Passion.</p>

<p>On the right and left, each in three divisions, are seated
figures of Apostles and other Saints. In the three lights
below the figure of our Lord are St. Michael and two
other angels, the one on the dexter side (the left side as
you look at it) bearing a Lily, the other on the sinister
(right) holding a flaming sword. St. Michael in the
centre is in full armour. He carries the scales of judgment,
and rests one hand on a cruciferous shield.</p>

<p>The lower portions of the lights show, on the one side,
the resurrection of the blessed, with angels receiving
them. A special feature of the design is seen in the
lowermost portion near the centre. Here appears the
figure of the founder, King Henry VI. He rises from his
grave gazing upward, and bearing in his hands a model
of the chapel itself. On the other side the lost are
shown, driven out by angels threatening them with
flaming swords.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>In the tracery are arranged various shields and
heraldic devices, which comprise the arms of Queen
Victoria, Henry VI, Henry VII, Henry VIII, the
Provost (Dr. Okes), the Visitor (the Bishop of Lincoln,
Chr. Wordsworth), F. E. Stacey, Esq. (the Donor), with
those of King's College, Eton College, and the University.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The question has often been asked, How did the
windows escape during the <i>Civil War</i>? There is one
story that the west window was broken by Cromwell's
soldiers (who certainly were quartered in the chapel),
and that the rest of the glass was taken out and concealed
inside the organ screen. Another, which appears in
a small book called "The Chorister," is that all the glass
was taken down and buried in pits in the college grounds
in one night by a man and a boy. Both these stories
are entirely fictitious. The best answer to the question
may be found in the words of the Provost of Eton (Dr.
M. R. James), who says, in one of his addresses on the
windows: "It is most probable that Cromwell, anxious
to have at least one of the universities on his side, gave
some special order that no wilful damage should be
wrought on this building, which, then as now, was the
pride of Cambridge and of all the country round." The
windows have been taken out and re-leaded at various
times&mdash;first between 1657 and 1664; next in 1711-1712;
thirdly in 1725-1730; fourthly in 1757-1765; fifthly in
1847-1850; and fourteen of them (one in each year) in a
period extending from 1893 to 1906, by the late Mr.
J. E. Kempe, when several mistakes which then existed
were put right.</p>

<h2>The Woodwork, Organ, etc.</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 323px;">

<span class="caption">H.A. from the Screen</span>
</div>

<div class='cap'>THE <i>Screen</i> dividing the choir from the ante-chapel
is one of the earliest and purest
examples of renaissance woodwork in this country
and is no doubt the work of foreign artists
(probably Italian), several having been brought
over and employed by Henry VIII. Carved
upon it are the badge of Anne Boleyn, a crowned
falcon holding a sceptre; the initials H. R.,
R. A., H. A., with true lovers' knots entwining
these two letters; the arms of Henry VIII and
Anne impaled; while below in the same compartment
is a bull's head caboched. This last is not a
rebus<a name="FNanchor_9_33" id="FNanchor_9_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_33" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in the true sense of the term (for at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
one would expect the letter N or something
similar to appear), yet I venture to say it refers
to Anne, and, with the rest, shows the date of the
work to be 1533-1536, during which period her
influence was at its height. At the back of the
Provost's stall is carved an admirable representation
of St. George and the dragon. Over the
door on this side are the arms of King's and Eton
emblazoned. The definition of the arms of King's
is as follows: Sable, three roses argent, a chief per
pale, azure a fleur-de-lis of France, and gules a
lion of England.<a name="FNanchor_10_34" id="FNanchor_10_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_34" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> That of Eton is the same,
with the exception of three lilies in the place of
the roses.<a name="FNanchor_11_35" id="FNanchor_11_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_35" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p><p>The organ was put up in 1688 by Ren&eacute; Harris,<a name="FNanchor_12_36" id="FNanchor_12_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_36" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
taking the place of one erected in 1606 by an
organ-builder named Dalham; some portions
of the case date back to the time of Henry VIII.
On the outer towers of the organ facing west
are two angels holding trumpets. These were
put up in 1859, taking the place of two pinnacles,
which in their turn were substituted for two
figures about the size of David on this same side.
In 1859 the organ was much enlarged by Messrs.
Hill, of London.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Coats of Arms</i> at the back of the stalls on
the north and south sides were put up at the
expense of Thomas Weaver, a former Fellow
of the College, in 1633. Amongst them are the
arms of England as they were at the time; those
of Henry V, VI, VII, VIII, Eton and King's
College&mdash;for Henry VI (no doubt following out
the scheme adopted by William of Wykeham,
who founded Winchester School and New College,
Oxford) founded Eton also&mdash;also the arms of
Cambridge University, and, to show a friendly
feeling to the sister University, those of Oxford
placed on the opposite side. The canopies of
the stalls and the panel work east of them were
executed in 1675-1679.</p>

<p>The <i>Altar Table</i>, from a design by Mr. Garner,
was first used on Advent Sunday, 1902; and the
woodwork round the chancel was finished in
1911. The architects were Messrs. Blow and
Billary, the work being executed by Messrs.
Rattee and Kett, the celebrated ecclesiastical
builders, of Cambridge.</p>

<p>The <i>Candelabra</i> which stand within the
Chancel, were the gift of Messrs. Bryan, Wayte,
and Witts, sometime Fellows; conjointly with
the College, and are of the date 1872.</p>

<p>The <i>Candlesticks</i> on the Altar were given by
Edward Balston, a former Fellow, in 1850; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the <i>Cross</i> (by Mr. Bainbridge Reynolds) is in
memory of the late Rev. Augustus Austen Leigh,
Provost, 1889-1905.</p>

<p>The <i>Picture</i> on the north side, "The Deposition,"
by Daniel de Volterra, was presented to
the College by the Earl of Carlisle in 1780. It
previously occupied the central position in the
woodwork placed there in 1774, and was removed
in 1896 when the east window was re-leaded.
The handsome <i>Lectern</i> was given to the College
by Robert Hacomblen, who was Provost from
1509 to 1528. The candle branches were added
in 1668. It was removed to the Library in 1774,
where it remained until 1854.</p>

<p>Before I go on to speak of the side Chapels, I
think it is worth recording that on Wednesday,
May 4, 1763, nine Spanish Standards taken at
Manilla by Brigadier General Draper, formerly
Fellow, were carried in procession to the Chapel
by the scholars of the College. A Te Deum was
sung, and the Revd. William Barford, Fellow,
and Public Orator, made a Latin oration. The
colours were first placed on each side of the Altar
rails, but afterwards were hung up on the Organ
Screen; they eventually found a resting-place
in one of the South Chapels. About 20 years
ago they were sent to a needlework guild in
London with a view to their being restored, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
it was found they were too far gone. Some of
the remnants that were returned are preserved
in a glass case in the vestry, where they may
be seen.</p>

<h2>The Side Chapels</h2>


<div class='cap'>I&nbsp;&nbsp;WOULD next draw the attention of my
readers to two of the side chapels. The
second from the west on the south side is known
as <i>Hacumblen's Chapel</i>, and contains a brass
marking the place of his burial. It also contains
a tomb (the only one in the Chapel) to the great
Duke of Marlborough's only son, John Churchill
Marquis of Blandford, who died of the small-pox
in 1702 while resident in College. In the window
next the Court is a portrait of the Founder, and
the other figure is St. John the Evangelist. In
the tracery are the evangelistic symbols and the
four fathers of the Latin church&mdash;St. Jerome,
St. Ambrose, St. Augustine and St. Gregory;
and in the window which divides the chantry
from the Ante-chapel is to be seen the Annunciation,
with, on the one side, St. Ursula and the
eleven thousand virgins, and St. Christopher
with the infant Jesus; on the other, St. Anne
with the Blessed Virgin, and St. John the Baptist
with the Lamb.</div>

<p>The third chapel on the same side is <i>Provost
Brassie's Chapel</i>, where he was buried in 1558.
In the window is some fifteenth century glass,
which, having been removed from the north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
side chapels, was repaired in 1857 and placed
here. The Provost of Eton, whose knowledge
of old glass makes him a competent authority,
is now of opinion that it was made for the side
Chapels, and was probably the gift of John
Rampaine, Vice-Provost in 1495.</p>

<p>Of the remaining chantries on the south side,
the first contains the Music Library; the next
three are to be utilized as a Library of Ancient
Theological works; and the last two will be fitted
up and dedicated, as a War Memorial to those
members of the College who made the great
sacrifice in the War 1914-1919. Some fine
Flemish glass, given by Mrs. Laurence Humphrey,
and two lights purchased of St. Catherine's
College, and other fragments of the XVth and
XVIth century of great interest and beauty have
already been placed in the windows, and a
reredos is in course of erection. In the window
of the second chantry from the west on the north
side are the arms of Roger Goad (Provost 1569-1610)
impaling the arms of the College,<a name="FNanchor_13_37" id="FNanchor_13_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_37" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in a
most beautiful floral border.</p>

<span class="caption">Arms of Henry VII. </span>
</div>
<p>Two other <i>Side Chapels</i> deserve to be mentioned,
viz. the two eastmost on the north side,
which were the first roofed with lierne vaulting.
The one furthest east has been lately restored
to use for early celebrations of the Holy Communion
and other devotional services. Visitors
should pay special attention to the lovely doorway
in stone through which you enter, and the
one on the opposite side. In the apex of the
arch are the arms of Edward the Confessor, on
the left those of East Anglia, on the right those
of England. On that of the opposite side is a
figure of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the top,
flanked on the right by one of St. Margaret, and
on the left by St. Catherine. These figures have
been defaced, probably by William Dowsing,
who is said to have gone about the country like
a lunatic, breaking windows, etc. He visited
the College in 1644.</p>

<p>The <i>Ante-chapel</i> is profusely decorated with
the arms of Henry VII, with a dragon and
greyhound as supporters, "the dragon of the
great Pendragonship" and the greyhound of
Cecilia Neville, wife of Richard Duke of York
in every severy, and with crowned roses and
portcullis alternating with each other, intimating
that, as the portcullis was the second defence of a
fortress when the gate was broken down, so he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
had a second claim to the crown through his
mother, daughter of John de Beaufort. After
the accession of the Tudor dynasty there arose a
mania for heraldic devices; in some cases an
unsatisfactory mode of decoration, but in this
building one that possesses not only historical
interest, but great decorative value.</p>

<p>During the time when these styles of Gothic
architecture prevailed that are now called the
Decorated and the Perpendicular, the roof,<a name="FNanchor_14_38" id="FNanchor_14_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_38" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the
columns, the stained glass windows, the seats,
altar, tombs, and even the flooring, were filled
with emblasonment. Nor was heraldic ornament
confined to architecture; it formed the grand
embellishment of the interior of palaces and
baronial castles.<a name="FNanchor_15_39" id="FNanchor_15_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_39" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In the middle of one of the roses at the west
end, toward the south, may be seen a small
figure of the Virgin Mary, about which Malden
says: "Foreigners make frequent enquiries, and
never fail to pay it a religious reverence, crossing
their breasts at the sight, and addressing it with a
short prayer." I cannot say that, in my long experience,
I have ever observed an instance of this.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>Memorials of the Dead</h2>


<div class='cap'>HAPPILY the chapel does not abound in
<i>epitaphs</i>, a species of memorial often extravagant
or even ridiculous, but there is one,
viz. of Thomas Crouch, a former Fellow, M.P.
for the University, who died 1679, written by
himself, which, in my opinion, is of a high
character. It is as follows:</div>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">"At the last day</span><br />
God will lay open the graves, and bring forth<br />
All men from their sepulchres.<br />
It shall be known, when that day<br />
Shall come, what manner of man I was."<br />
</div>

<p>One may notice two striking features contained
in this epitaph: (1) He believes in the
resurrection; (2) he does not care what man
thinks of him, it is God who shall decide whether
he was good or bad.</p>

<p>Money was not a dominant motive with those
employed on our old buildings, but master and
man worked together for a common object, with
a common sympathy; and especially in our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
cathedrals and minsters they kept uppermost
in their minds that they were working for the
glory of God. "They thought not of a perishable
home Who thus could build."</p>

<p>Froude, in his <i>History of England</i> (I. 51), says
of our ancestors: "They cannot come to us, and
our imaginations can but feebly penetrate to
them. Only among the aisles of the cathedrals,
only as we gaze upon their silent figures sleeping
on their tombs, some faint conceptions float
before us of what these men were when they
were alive."</p>

<p>There are four <i>Sepulchral Brasses</i> on the floor
of the chantries. The earliest one is that of Dr.
William Towne, who is buried in the second
chantry from the east, to which I have already
referred as being the first roofed in. He is
represented in academical costume; and on his
hands hangs a scroll with the following words:
"Farewell to glory, to reputation in learning,
to praise, to the arts, to all the vanity of this
world. God is my only hope."<a name="FNanchor_16_40" id="FNanchor_16_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_40" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Under his
feet is the inscription: "Pray for the soul of
Master William Towne, Doctor of Divinity, once
a Fellow of this College, who died on the eleventh
day of March, 1494. Whose soul God pardon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Amen." The words "Pray for the soul" and
"Whose soul God pardon. Amen," have been
partially effaced.<a name="FNanchor_17_41" id="FNanchor_17_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_41" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The most ancient brass after Dr. Towne's is that
of Dr. Argentine, who is buried in the vestry on
the south side nearest to the east. His figure
is placed, according to his last desire, on the
tombstone in his doctoral robes, with his hands
elevated towards the upper part of the stone,
where there was formerly placed a Crucifix.
From his mouth proceed these words: "O
Christ, Son of God and the Virgin, crucified
Lord, Redeemer of mankind, remember me."
Below his feet are the words: "This stone buries
the body of John Argentine, Master of Arts,
Physician, Preacher of the Gospel; Passenger,
remember, thou art mortal; pray in an humble
posture, that my soul may live in Christ, in a
state of immortality." On a fillet round the
tombstone the following words are engraved:
"Pray for the soul of John Argentine, Master of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Arts, Doctor of Physick and Divinity, and
Provost of this College, who died February 2,
1507. May God have mercy on his soul.
Amen."<a name="FNanchor_18_42" id="FNanchor_18_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_42" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The next is that of Robert Hacumblen, in the
second chantry from the west on the same side.
He is represented in ecclesiastical costume in
processional vestments. On a label proceeding
from his mouth is inscribed the following line:
"O Christ, be thy wounds my pleasing remedy."
This applies to a shield in the sinister corner of
the stone, which represents the five wounds of
Christ. The shield in the dexter corner is
missing. It probably contained his coat of
arms, which were: vert, a cross saltire argent
between four lilies of the second. On the fillet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
which on all sides surrounds the stone, are the
words:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"O Lord, judge me not according to my actions.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I have done nothing worthy in Thy sight.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Therefore I beseech Thy majesty,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That Thou, O God, wouldst blot out my iniquity.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Have mercy, Jesu."</span><br />
</div>

<p>At the corners are the evangelistic emblems.
The inscription that was under his feet has been
taken away. It may be that it contained the
words "Pray for the soul," etc.</p>

<p>The fourth brass is in the next chantry toward
the east, and is that of Robert Brassie. He is
also in ecclesiastical costume in processional
vestments, without the cope exposing the almuce.
The label that proceeded from his mouth is
missing. At his feet are the following words:
"Here lies Robert Brassie, Doctor of Divinity,
formerly Provost of this College, who departed
this life November 10, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1558."</p>

<p>On the walls of the Ante-chapel there are
several <i>Memorial Brasses</i>. The oldest is a
diamond-shaped one, on the left of the south
porch, to the memory of John Stokys, Public
Orator, who died 17th July, 1559. That of a
similar shape on the right is a repouss&eacute; tablet
in copper, and is to the memory of J. K. Stephen,
Fellow, who died February, 1892. In the last
bay is one to Richard Okes, Doctor in Theology,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
who was Provost of the College from 1850 to
1888.</p>

<p>On the north wall there are seven tablets.
Taking them in order of death, the first is to
Roland Williams, S.T.P., Fellow, who died
15th February, 1870. Then Henry Bradshaw,
M.A., Fellow, University Librarian, died 15th
February, 1886; William Johnson (afterwards
Cory), M.A., Fellow, and for many years a Master
at Eton, died 1892; Charles Vickery Hawkins,
Scholar, died 6th August, 1894; John Henry
Middleton, M.A., Professorial Fellow, Slade
Professor, died 1896; Arthur Thomas Reid,
Scholar, who met his death in climbing a mountain
near Bangor, North Wales, September,
1907; Frederick Whitting, M.A., Senior Fellow,
who was for 24 years Bursar and 20 years Vice-Provost,
died suddenly in London, 1st January,
1911. Other tablets in the chantries commemorate
various members of the College.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<div class='cap'>LIKE human beings, the chapel has received
well-merited praise from many, while some
have used their knowledge (or want of it) to
criticise. Fuller speaks of it "as one of the
rarest fabricks in Christendom, wherein the
stonework, woodwork, and glasswork contend
which shall deserve most admiration." To
quote Carter again: "It is entitled to be ranked
with the finest buildings of the world," although
he further goes on to say: "The exterior aspect
is perhaps justly open to some criticism, but
it has received unqualified abuse at the hands
of some writers." Ruskin was very severe,
comparing it to a billiard table, turned upside
down, the four corner turrets being the four legs;
but he afterwards, it is said, retracted. The
late Rev. Augustus Austen Leigh, Provost of
the College from 1888 to 1905, in writing a history
of the College, says: "Like other really great
works, King's Chapel produces an impression
which is instantaneous, and at the same time
permanent. It does not disarm criticism, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
it compels admiration. And if anyone is inclined
to criticise, let him look at the exterior on a moonlight
night from the south side of the Quadrangle,
or from the top of Trinity Street, or let him take
his stand within the ante-chapel at the northwest
corner on a bright summer's day, and cast
his eye along the coloured glass and stone vaulting
till he catches a part of the east window
rising above the stately rood-loft; and if he does
not feel that there is an inspiration in the building
which is above criticism, he must be a man that
hath no music in himself."</div>

<p>I cannot end this brief sketch better than by
quoting Wordsworth's two famous sonnets on
King's College Chapel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Henry was born at Windsor in the year 1421. When
Henry V was informed that Catherine had borne him an
heir he asked: Where was the boy born? At Windsor was
the reply. Turning to his Chamberlain, he gave voice to
the following prophetic utterance:
</p><div class='poem2'>
"I Henry born at Monmouth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall small time reign, and much get;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But Henry of Windsor shall long reign and loose all.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But as God will, so be it."</span><br />

January 1441, and confirmed by Act of Parliament in
February of the same year, as translated, reads as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"To the honour of Almighty God, in whose hand are
the hearts of Kings; of the most blessed and immaculate
Virgin Mary, mother of Christ; and also of the glorious
Confessor and Bishop Nicholas, Patron of my intended
College, on whose festival we first saw the light."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In the College Library may be seen a small piece of silk
in which his bones were wrapped, and which was taken
from the coffin by the late Sir W. H. St. John Hope in the
presence of Dr. M. R. James, when it was opened on the
4th November, 1910.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The accounts show that a chapel existed from the
beginning, and that it stood between the south side of the
old court and the north side of the present Chapel. It
consisted of a chancel, nave, and ante-chapel, and had a
door at the west end, and east and west windows. It was
richly fitted up; and numerous allusions to plate, hangings,
relics, service books, vestments, choristers and large and
small organs, show that the services were performed with
full attention to the ritual of the day.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> He was buried in his chapel at Westminster beside that
of his wife, Elizabeth of York. Lord Bacon says "He
lieth at Westminster in one of the stateliest and daintiest
monuments of Europe both for the chapel and the sepulchre.
So that he dwelleth more richly dead in the monument of
his tomb than he did alive in Richmond or in any of his
palaces."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_M_20" id="Footnote_M_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_M_20"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> There was originally only half a window here. The lower half was intended to have a
building (which was in part begun) abutting on it. This building was removed in 1827, and
the lower part of the window opened up. The old glass was moved down to the lower lights
in 1841, and in 1845 the glass which now occupies the upper main lights inserted by Hedgeland.
The only thing that can be said in its favour is its vivid colours.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_W_30" id="Footnote_W_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_W_30"><span class="label">[W]</span></a> In this subject is a beautiful specimen of a late fifteenth century ship. The ship has
her sails furled, and is anchored by her port anchor as her starboard anchor is fished (<i>i.e.</i> made
fast with its shank horizontal) to the ship's side by her cable. An empty boat is alongside.
At the top of the mainmast is a fighting top from which project two large spears.
</p>

<p>An excellent article on this ship was contributed by Messrs. H. H. Brindley, M.A., and Alan
H. Moore, B.A., and read to the members of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society in 1909.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_33" id="Footnote_9_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_33"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> A rebus was invariably a badge or device forming a
pun upon a man's surname. It probably originated in the
canting heraldry of earlier days. A large number of
rebuses ending in "ton" are based upon a tun or barrel;
such are the <i>lup</i> on a <i>ton</i> of Robert Lupton, Provost of
Eton 1504, which appears in the spandrils of the door in
the screen leading into his chapel at Eton College, or the
<i>kirk</i> and <i>ton</i> of Abbott Kirkton on the deanery gate at
Peterborough. The <i>eye</i> and the <i>slip</i> of a tree, which form,
together with a man falling from a tree (I slip!), the rebuses
of Abbot Islip, are well known. The <i>ox</i> crossing a <i>ford</i> in
the arms of Oxford, and the <i>Cam</i> and its great <i>bridge</i> in
the arms of Cambridge are kindred examples.</p></div>

denote the perpetuity of his foundation; by the roses, his
hope that the college might bring forth the choicest flowers,
redolent of science of every kind, to the honour and most
devout worship of Almighty God and the undefiled virgin
and glorious mother; and by the chief, containing portions
of the arms of France and England, he intended to impart
something of royal nobility, which might declare the work
to be truly regal and renowned."&mdash;<i>Cooper's Memorials of

May 20, 1919, the following reference was made to the arms
of Eton:&mdash;
</p>
<div class='poem2'>
"What bears Etona on her shield?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">What each true son should be;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A lion valiant in the field;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">At heart a fleur-de-lis."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Daily Telegraph</i>, May 21, 1919.</span></div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_36" id="Footnote_12_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_36"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Mr. T. F. Bumpas in his <i>London Churches, Ancient and
Modern</i>, speaks of him as an organ builder of some note.
Renatus Harris he is there styled. "In 1663 the Benchers
of the Temple Church being anxious of obtaining the best
possible organ, we find him in competition with one Bernard
Schmidt, a German, who afterwards became Anglicized as
'Father Smith.' Each builder erected an organ which were
played on alternate Sundays. Dr. Blow and Purcell played
upon Smith's organ, while Draghi, organist to the Queen
Consort, Catherine of Braganza, touched Harrises. The
conflict was very severe and bitter. Smith was successful.
Harrises organ having been removed, one portion of it was
acquired by the parishioners of St. Andrew's, Holborn,
while the other was shipped to Dublin, where it remained
in Christ Church Cathedral until 1750, when it was purchased
for the Collegiate Church of Wolverhampton. In
1684 he competed again with Father Smith for the contract
for an organ for St. Laurance, Gresham Street, and was
successful. In 1669 he built a fine large organ for St.
Andrews, Undershaft." He was also engaged in 1693 to
keep in order the organ in Jesus College Chapel, Cambridge,
at a yearly salary of &pound;3.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_37" id="Footnote_13_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_37"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Heads of Colleges have the right of impaling with their
own arms the arms of the College of which they are the head
in the same way as a Bishop impales the arms of the See
over which he presides. Deans of secular churches and the
Regius Professors of Divinity at Cambridge (since 1590)
have the same privilege.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_41" id="Footnote_17_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_41"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The words "Pray for the soul," or "May whose soul
God pardon," were sufficient excuse for fanatics such as
Dowsing to destroy or deface the beautiful brasses in
various parts of the kingdom. But the fanatics were not
alone to blame; for it is well known that churchwardens
and even incumbents of our churches have in many cases
taken up and sold the brasses to satisfy some whim of their
own in what they called "restoration" of the edifice over
which they had charge.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_42" id="Footnote_18_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_42"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> It may appear to my readers somewhat strange that
in this case the words "Pray for the soul" and "May God
have mercy, &amp;c." are intact. Until 1898 this chantry had a
boarded floor above the slab, the fillet round not being
visible. The figure itself with label was affixed to a board
and placed in the vestry for those who cared to inspect it.
When the floor was removed the Brass was placed in its
proper place on the slab and the whole inscription could
then be seen. There are the matrixes of four coats of
arms. Probably they were King's, Eton, the University,
and Argentine's own coat, which was gules, three covered
cups argent. At the upper corners of the fillet are the
evangelistic emblems of St. Matthew and St. John, while
those of St. Mark and St. Luke, which were evidently at
the bottom, have been taken away.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_Z_44" id="Footnote_Z_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Z_44"><span class="label">[Z]</span></a> It is very strange, but there is no evidence of Provost Day
having taken a degree of any kind. He was Master of St.
John's College, Cambridge, 1537; Provost, 1538; Bishop of
Chichester, 1543. On making enquiry at Chichester, the answer
is "We have no reference whatever to his having taken a
degree, odd as this is to us."</p></div>
